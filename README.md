# README for pac_SAm respository

This repository includes notebooks with Python code used to build figures for the article "Pacific Interannual and Multidecadal Variability recorded in <span style="white-space: nowrap;">$\delta$<sup>18</sup>O</span> of South American Summer Monsoon precipitation," (in review at the Journal of Geophysical Resaerch Letters: Atmospheres) (<italics>reference will be inserted when available</italics>).

Abstract:

-------------
### The following scripts are included: 
- F1_tpi_n34_inds.ipynb: Figure 1 shows the TPI and ENSO indices of variability in the study period. 
- F2_SASM_proxyloc_ocnmodes.ipynb: Figure 2 shows the spatial domains used for the TPI and ENSO index calculations, DJF climatological features of South American Monsoon Climate (low-level (850 hPa) wind field, DJF percent of annual rainfall, and the locations of terrestrial $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O archives used in the study.
- F3_Composites_d18o_obs_icam5_gnip_climoIPO_ENSO.ipynb: Figure 3 shows the DJF climatology of $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> and differences of $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> fields from iCAM5 simulations and terrestrial archives between positive and negative phases of the Pacific modes (IPO, ENSO).
- F4_Correlations_iso_precip_pts.ipynb: Figure 4 shows correlations between hydroclimate variables ($\omega$500, $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>, precipitation) and IPO, ENSO. from iCAM5 simulations, terrestrial archives, and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitaiton product
- F5_enso_runcorr-AMO.ipynb: Figure 5 shows temporal correlations illustrating oxygen isotope fractionation mechanisms and coupling between South America $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> and ocean modes.
- F6_Composites_Walker_icam5_ipo_eso_diff.ipynb: Figure 6 shows longitudinal cross sections of the South American Walker circulation and $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O<sub>v</sub> and specific humidity for the DJF seasonal climatology and difference plots for the warm -- cold phase of IPO, ENSO.
- F7_Regression_N34_IPO_var.ipynb: Figure 7 shows the upper troposphere wind field and geopotential height field (200 hPa) for the DJF seasonal climatology and regression fields between IPO, ENSO and the dynamic variables.
- FS1_Correlations_precip.ipynb: Figure S1 is the same as Figure 4, but for only precipitation and IPO, ENSO indices, using the full GPCC gridded product.
